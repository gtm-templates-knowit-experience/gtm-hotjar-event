## Settings
Add a **Event Name** and a **GTM Trigger** to the Tag.

The **Event Name** must not exceed 750 characters, and can only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), underscores (_), and dashes (-).

## Combine Hotjar Event with User Attributes targeting
If you are going to combine **Events** with [**Hotar User Attribute-based targeting**](https://github.com/gtm-templates-knowit-experience/gtm-hotjar-user-attributes) for Surveys or Incoming Feedback, you should ensure that the Attributes happens before the Event.

If the Event is triggered before User Attributes has finished execution, the Survey/Incoming Feedback will not show.
