## Settings
Add a **Event Name** and a **GTM Trigger** to the Tag.

## Combine Hotjar Event with User Attributes targeting
If you are going to combine **Events** with [**Hotar User Attribute-based targeting**](https://github.com/gtm-templates-knowit-experience/gtm-hotjar-user-attributes) for Surveys or Incoming Feedback, you should ensure that the Attributes happens before the Event.

If the Event is triggered before User Attributes has finished execution, the Survey/Incoming Feedback will not show. 

## Some final notes about this Template
